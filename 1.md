# 1. Generics types as a factory

This pattern is used in **Microsoft.Extensions.\*** and in **Microsoft.AspNetCore.\***. The idea is that you can use a generic type as a factory instead of a function. The type argument is the 
type you want to instantiate. Consider the example below where we have an `IServiceFactory<TService>` that can resolve the `TService` from the DI container or creates an instance if it's 
not in the container.

```C#
public interface IServiceFactory<TService>
{
    TService Service { get; }
}

public class ServiceFactory<TService> : IServiceFactory<TService>
{
    public ServiceFactory(IServiceProvider service)
    {
        Service = (TService)service.GetService(typeof(TService)) ?? ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<TService>(service);
    }

    public TService Service { get; private set; }
}
```

The constructor has a access to any service *and* the generic type being requested. These open generic services are registered like this:

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient(typeof(IServiceFactory<>), typeof(ServiceFactory<>));
}
```
