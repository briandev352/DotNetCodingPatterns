## Generics types as a factory

This pattern is used in **Microsoft.Extensions.\*** and in **Microsoft.AspNetCore.\***. The idea is that you can use a generic type as a factory instead of a function. The type argument is the 
type you want to instantiate. Consider the example below where we have an `IServiceFactory<TService>` that can resolve the `TService` from the DI container or creates an instance if it's 
not in the container.

```C#
public interface IServiceFactory<TService>
{
    TService Service { get; }
}

public class ServiceFactory<TService> : IServiceFactory<TService>
{
    public ServiceFactory(IServiceProvider service)
    {
        Service = (TService)service.GetService(typeof(TService)) ?? ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<TService>(service);
    }

    public TService Service { get; private set; }
}
```

The constructor has a access to any service *and* the generic type being requested. These open generic services are registered like this:

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient(typeof(IServiceFactory<>), typeof(ServiceFactory<>));
}
```

## Single implementation multiple interfaces in Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection

Let's say you had a type that implemented multiple interfaces and you wanted to expose it using the DI container. The built in `IServiceCollection` type doesn't natively support this but it's easy to emulate using the following pattern.

```C#
public class FooAndBar : IFoo, IBar
{
   // Imagine a useful implementation
}
```

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<FooAndBar>();
    services.AddSingleton<IFoo>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<FooAndBar>());
    services.AddSingleton<IBar>(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<FooAndBar>());
}
```

This will let me resolve `FooAndBar`, `IFoo` and `IBar` and it will give me the same instance.

## Creating instances of types from an IServiceProvider

Usually you need to register a type in order to instantiate instances of a type from the DI container, somebody needs to call `IServiceProvider.GetService`. This means that the service needs to be registered in the container. There's a useful utility called [ActivatorUtilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0) that can be used as a factory for types that haven't been registered, but have dependencies that are registered in the DI container.

```C#
public class MyDependency
{
    public MyDependency(ILogger logger)
    {
    }
}
```

```C#
public class MyDependencyFactory
{
    private IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    public MyDependencyFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider
    }
    public MyDependency GetInstance()
    {
        return ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<MyDependency>(_serviceProvider);
    }
}
```

You can build a more optimized version of this uses the [`CreateFactory`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities.createfactory?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0#Microsoft_Extensions_DependencyInjection_ActivatorUtilities_CreateFactory_System_Type_System_Type___). This will pre-calculate the constructor 
based on the types passed and build a factory for it.

```C#
public class MyDependencyFactory
{
    private ObjectFactory _factory;
    public MyDependencyFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _factory = ActivatorUtilities.CreateFactory(typeof(MyDependency), Type.EmptyTypes);
    }
    public MyDependency GetInstance()
    {
        return _factory(_serviceProvider, null);
    }
}
```

**NOTE: Disposable instances created with this API will not be disposed by the DI container.**

## Caching singletons in generic types

If you need to cache an instance of something based on type, then you the field on a generic type.

```C#
public class Factory
{
    public T Create<T>()
    {
        return Cache<T>.Instance;
    }
    
    private class Cache<T>
    {
        public T Instance = new T();
    }
}
```

You can use the JIT to cache instances on your behalf instead of a slower `ConcurrentDictionary<Type, T>`.
